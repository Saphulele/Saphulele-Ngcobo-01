# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell with either "X" or "O".
The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols before the opponent does.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. It is a simple yet engaging game that tests logic and strategic thinking.
